## How do I use the documentation?

Fist you see an overview of the articles in the documentation.
It is not a classic manual it is more like an encyclopedia.
You can search for an article by typing letters that occur in the topic you want.
You do not have to click on the search button, because you see the outcome right away.

Just click on a [link][self] to read more about a specific topic.

You can go back to the overview by clicking on
<a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" iconcolor="white"><i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-left"></i> Back to overview</a>
in the upper right corner.

If not additional mentioned,
displayed buttons in articles are not working,
so you can click on them without worries,
because nothing will happen,
except of color changes.

In many articles there are links to
other articles in the documentation
or the menu entry
or the create a new item page
or another section in your current article.
All links are text-based links,
no button in any article will link you to somewhere else
even if something happens,
if you click on the button.

To go back you can click on the button in the upper right corner or click [here][Documentation].
