Most modern web browsers like Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge provide a _Notification API_.

openITCOCKPIT can use this API to send a push notification to your browser. You can use this as a notification
method for all objects that are monitored by the system.


## Requirements
- Modern web browser
- openITCOCKPIT needs to be open in one tab (Browser window can be in the background or task bar)
- Contact needs to be assigned to a user.
- `Push notifications to browser` needs to be enabled in contact configuration
- `push_notification` service needs to be running on the openITCOCKPIT server

## Setup push notifications

### Browser permissions
Before openITCOCKPIT can send you notifications, your web browser will ask you to grant permissions for browser notifications.
This is a security feature of all browsers, to avoid than random websites will send you spam messages.

**You can always grant or revoke the permissions.**

In this example, we show the process using Mozilla Firefox.

#### Grant permissions
The question, if you want to receive notifications of openITCOCKPIT, will popup automatically.

#### Revoke permissions
To revoke the permissions, click on `Show site information` in the browser address bar.

If you revoked permissions, because you don't want to get any push notifications of openITCOCKPIT, please also disable
`Push notifications to browser` in your contact configuration.

### Create or edit an existing contact
To recive push notifications, you need to link your user account with a contact of the monitoring engine. By default,
all contacts don't belong to any user that exists in the openITCOCKPIT interface.

1. Select the user that should get browser notifications.
2. Enable `Push notifications to browser` for hosts and/or services.

The command `host-notify-by-browser-notification` and/or `service-notify-by-browser-notification` will be selected
automatically.

If the commands are missing on your system, please read the **Troubleshooting** part of this article.

You can also add other notification commands like notify by email and browser notifications and so on.

After you edited the contact, please make sure to "Refresh your monitoring configuration":

### Notification examples
Every notification will container an icon for host or services. The current state is represented by the color of the icon.
By clicking on the notification, a new browser tab will navigate you to the corresponding host or service. The notification will disappear automatically after a few seconds.

_Notice: The notification design is provided by the operating system. Notifications may be look different on different operating systems.
There is no way to use a different style for the notifications._

#Troubleshooting

- Connectivity issues. If your browser lost connection to the openITCOCKPIT server, it could happen that you will not receive push notifications. Refresh the page to resolve the issue.

- `push_notification` service not running. This background daemon needs to be up and running. Also your web server configuration
or reverse proxy configuration could be cause an issue.
You can check the developer tools of your browser, to check if there is a connectivity issue:
Issue (`push_notification` not running):

Successfully connected:

- Some applications may suppress browser notifications. We notice this behavior on Microsoft Windows 7 in combination with `Snipping Tool`.
A refresh of the openITCOCKPIT page resolved the issue.

- Too many notifications could also result in a suppressing issue. Try to reduce the amount of receive push notifications.

- Check if an update for your web browser is available.

- Does the notifications work in Internet Explorer? No.
